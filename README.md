# Simple Text Editor with Draft.js
This project is a simple text editor created using Create React App and integrated with Draft.js, a framework for building rich text editors in React.

## Getting Started
To run the project, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditya2z/text-editor.git
```

## Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the text editor in your browser. The page will reload as you make changes, and lint errors can be seen in the console.

## Features

- Basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline).
- Lists (both ordered and unordered).
- Undo and redo functionality.
- Draft.js provides a flexible and extensible framework for building rich text editing experiences.

### Additional Features

- Typing `#` as the first string in a line & pressing space makes anything you type afterwards on the same line be in a “Heading” format. On pressing space, the aforementioned `#` disappears.
  - Example: Typing `# This is a heading` results in a heading format.

- Typing `*` as the first string in a line and pressing space corresponds to “bold” format.
  - Example: Typing `* This is bold text*` results in bold formatting.

- Typing `**` and space creates a red line.
  - Example: Typing `** This is a red line**` results in a red line.

- Typing `***` and space creates an underline.
  - Example: Typing `*** This is underlined***` results in underline formatting.

- Pressing `Save` button persists everything typed in the editor into `localStorage`. On refreshing the page, the saved info is refilled into the editor.
